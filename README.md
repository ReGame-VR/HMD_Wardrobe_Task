Changes that need to be made to Shelves
	The shelves are built through blender using the Archimesh plugin (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9P3DovRYP8). The shelves are complete, however, they need to adjusted in size to better match the dimensions of the real shelves. After they are adjusted, they can be exported in whatever preferred file format, and used in Unity.
